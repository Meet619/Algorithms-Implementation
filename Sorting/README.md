# Sorting
---
A **Sorting Algorithms** are used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure.


## 1. Bubble Sort
---
Bubble sort is based on the idea of repeatedly comparing pairs of adjacent elements and then swapping their positions if they exist in the wrong order.

Lets try to understand the algorithm with an example:
A [ ] = { 7, 4, 5, 2}

This array can be sorted using the following steps.
